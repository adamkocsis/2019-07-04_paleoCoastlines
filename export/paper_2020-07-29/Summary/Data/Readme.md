## Description

ESRI vector shapefiles of continental margins and coastlines are included. Continental margins are -1400m isobaths of the PaleoMAP PaleoDEMs (https://www.earthbyte.org/paleodem-resource-scotese-and-wright-2018/). Coastlines are adjusted from the PaleoDEMs to represent maximum transgressive surfaces, as indicated by the stage-level fossil occurences of the Paleobiology Database (https://paleobiodb.org).

The dataset is intended to supplement the journal article describing it, which is in preparation. This is version 7.1.

## Contents

./CM/ - continental margins
./CS/ - coastlines
./paleomap_model_v19o_r1c/ - The "v19o_r1c" version of the paleomap rotation file, with the corresponding partitioning polygons.
./png_equirect/ - Equirectangular projection of the plotted paleocoastlines with present-day coastlines. (3600x1800)
./png_mollweide/ - Mollweide projection of the plotted paleocoastlines with present-day coastlines. (3600x1800)
./equirectangular.pdf- Equirectangular projection of the plotted paleocoastlines (vector)
./mollweide.pdf - Mollweide projection of the plotted paleocoastlines (vector)


## Change log

## [Version 7.1]  - 2020-11-26

No changes were done to the polygons files, but they are also provided in .gpml format. 
Added plotted versions of the shapes in .pdf and .png format in equirectangular and Mollweide projections.


## [Version 7]  - 2020-09-07
